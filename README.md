# Penny-Pincher : A Budget Tracking PWA

## Description

We are giving users a fast and easy way to track their money, we are also allowing them to access that information at any time, even offline. 
The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online
